# Big O

## Recursive Runtimes

What is the runtime of this code?

```javascript
  function f(n) {
    if (n <= 1) {
      return 1;
    }
    return f(n-1) + f(n-2);
  }
```

The tree will have depth N. Each node has two children. Therefore each level will have twice as many calls as the one above it.

| Level  | #Nodes  | Also expressed as...  | Or...  |
|---|---|:---:|---:|
| 1 | 1  |   | $2^0$  |
| 2 | 2  | 2 * previous level = 2  | $2^1$  |
| 3 | 4  | 2 * previous level = 2 * $2^1$  | $2^2$  |
| 4 | 8  | 2 * previous level = 2 * $2^2$  | $2^3$  |
| 5 | 16 | 2 * previous level = 2 * $2^3$  | $2^4$  |

Therefore, there will be $2^0$ + $2^1$ + $2^2$ + .... + $2^N$ = $2^{N+1}$ - 1 [demonstration](./math-formular.md#sum-of-powers-of-2)

> ðŸŽ¯ when you have a recursive function that makes multiple calls, the runtime will often (but not always as in the case the number is 1 so O(n)) look like O($branches^{depth}$)
>
> ðŸŽ¯ the base of a log does not matter for big O since logs of different bases are  only different by a constant factor.

## Examples

* **`Suppose we had an algorithm that took in an array of strings, sorted each string, and then sorted the full array. What would the runtime be?`**
  * let `s` be the length of the longest string.
  * let `a` be the length of the array.
  * Soting each string is **`O(s log s)`**. We do this for every string, so that's **`O(a*s log s)`**.
  * Now we have to sort all the strings. This could be **`O(a log a)`**. But it is incorrect, because compare two strings takes **`O(s)`**. So the correct runtime is **`O(s*a log a)`**
  * Finally the total runtime is **`O(a*s(log s + log a)`**
