# Big O

## Recursive Runtimes

What is the runtime of this code?

```javascript
function f(n) {
  if (n <= 1) {
    return 1;
  }
  return f(n - 1) + f(n - 2);
}
```

![tree](big-O-2020-03-18-14-09-38.png)

The tree will have depth N. Each node has two children. Therefore each level will have twice as many calls as the one above it.

| Level | #Nodes |       Also expressed as...       |   Or... |
| ----- | ------ | :------------------------------: | ------: |
| 1     | 1      |                                  | $`2^0`$ |
| 2     | 2      |     2 \* previous level = 2      | $`2^1`$ |
| 3     | 4      | $`2 * previous level = 2 + 2^1`$ | $`2^2`$ |
| 4     | 8      | $`2 * previous level = 2 + 2^2`$ | $`2^3`$ |
| 5     | 16     | $`2 * previous level = 2 + 2^3`$ | $`2^4`$ |

Therefore, there will be $`2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + .... + 2^N = 2^{N+1} - 1`$ [demonstration](./math-formular.md#sum-of-powers-of-2)

> ðŸŽ¯ when you have a recursive function that makes multiple calls, the runtime will often (but not always as in the case the number is 1 so O(n)) look like O($branches^{depth}$)
>
> ðŸŽ¯ the base of a log does not matter for big O since logs of different bases are only different by a constant factor.

## Log N Runtimes

When you see a problem where the number of elements in the problem gets halved each time, that will likely be a $`O(log n)`$ runtime.

## Examples

#### **`Suppose we had an algorithm that took in an array of strings, sorted each string, and then sorted the full array. What would the runtime be?`**


  - let `s` be the length of the longest string.
  - let `a` be the length of the array.
  - Soting each string is **`O(s log s)`**. We do this for every string, so that's **`O(a*s log s)`**.
  - Now we have to sort all the strings. This could be **`O(a log a)`**. But it is incorrect, because compare two strings takes **`O(s)`**. So the correct runtime is **`O(s*a log a)`**
  - Finally the total runtime is **`O(a*s(log s + log a)`**

#### **`Suppose the following code prints all Fibonacci numbers from 0 to n. What is its time complexity?`**

```typescript
function allFib(n: number): void {
  for (let i; i < n; i++) {
    console.log(`i : ${fib(i)}`);
  }
}

function fib(n: number): number {
  if (n <= 0) return 0;
  else if (n == 1) return 1;
  return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
}
```

since `fib(b)` takes $`O(2^n)`$ time and it's called `n` times, then it's $`O(n * 2^n)`$ => **WRONG** ðŸ˜­

let walk through each call

`fib(1)` -> $`2^1`$ steps <br />
`fib(2)` -> $`2^2`$ steps <br />
`fib(3)` -> $`2^3`$ steps <br />
...

=> Total is: $`2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 + ... + 2^n = 2^{n+1} - 1`$ and the answer is $`O(2^n)`$

#### **`The following code performs integer division`**

```typescript
function div(a: number, int: number): number {
  let count = 0;
  let sum = b;
  while (sum <= a) {
    sum += b;
    count++;
  }
  return count;
}
```

the number of loop equals to `count`. So the rum time is $`O(log(a/b)`$

---

#### **`You are looking for a specific value in a binary tree, but the tree is not a binary search tree. What is the time complexity of this?`**

It takes $`O(n)`$ as need to search all elements of the tree.

---

#### **`The following code sums the digits in a number`**

```typescript
function sumDigits(n: number): number {
  let sum = 0;
  while (sum > 0) {
    sum += n % 10;
    n /= 10;
  }
  return sum;
}
```

The rumtime will be the numbers of digits int the number. A number with $`d`$ digits has a runtime up to $`10^d`$. if $`n = 10^d`$ then $`logd = n`$ => the runtime is $`O(log n)`$
